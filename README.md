# makemkv-auto-install
Installer script for MakMKV on Linux. DISCLAIMER: This has ZERO safety checks. It just does it's thing. Please check for potential issues beforehand.
This script is more of a note to myself than actually being targeted at broader usage. It's been tested on a fresh, fully patched Ubuntu 20.04.1 script and needs to be executed with sudo.
